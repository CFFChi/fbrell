rell
====

Facebook Read Eval Log Loop is an interactive environment for exploring the
Facebook Connect JavaScript SDK. The SDK is available
[here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/).

[Try it out](https://www.fbrell.com/examples/).

Development Environment
-----------------------

You'll need [Go](https://golang.org/) to work on rell. Once you have it:

```sh
go get github.com/daaku/rell
rell
```

Then go to http://localhost:43600/. Look at the help text from `rell -h` to see
what other options are available. You'll need your own
[Facebook Application](https://developers.facebook.com/) and
a [Parse Application](https://parse.com/) to make some of the features
available.
