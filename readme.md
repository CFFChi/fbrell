Facebook Read Eval Log Loop is an interactive environment for exploring the
Facebook Connect JavaScript SDK. The SDK is available
[here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/).

[Try it out](https://www.fbrell.com/examples/).

Development Environment
-----------------------

You'll need [Go](https://golang.org/) to work on rell. Once you have it:

```sh
go get github.com/daaku/rell
rell --fb-app-id=<app-id>
```

Look at the help text from `rell -h` to see what other options are available.
