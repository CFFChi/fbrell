<h1>Force Popups</h1>
<p>
FB.ui() will use <em>iframe dialogs</em> when the user is connected with your
site, and <em>window popups</em> otherwise. This is a security restriction. In
certain scenarios, you may <strong>always</strong> want to use <em>window
popups</em>. This can be achieved by passing <strong>display=popup</strong>
to the FB.ui() call as demonstrated here.
</p>

<script>
var publish = {
  method: 'stream.publish',
  display: 'popup', // force popup mode
  attachment: {
    name: 'Connect',
    caption: 'The Facebook Connect JavaScript SDK',
    description: (
      'A small JavaScript library that allows you to harness ' +
      'the power of Facebook, bringing the user\'s identity, ' +
      'social graph and distribution power to your site.'
    ),
    href: 'http://www.fbrell.com/'
  }
};

FB.ui(publish, Log.info.bind('stream.publish callback'));
</script>
